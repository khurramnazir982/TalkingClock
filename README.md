# TalkingClock
This is an application which takes in a String of time and returns time in a human friendly manner

This is a 2 part solution to the Human Talking clock problem.

1st Solution which can be found in CommandLineSolution is a command-line program that returns either the current time
using the "Human Friendly Text" or a time string as a "Human Friendly Text", that is provided by the user.

Numeric Time Human Friendly Text

•	1:00 One o'clock
•	2:00 Two o'clock
•	13:00 One o'clock
•	13:05 Five past one
•	13:10 Ten past one
•	13:25 Twenty five past one
•	13:30 Half past one
•	13:35 Twenty five to two
•	13:55 Five to two

For example, executing this program at 16:30, would output "Half past four".
For example, executing this program with a String "17:30", would output "Half past five".

2nd Solution which can be found in RestAPISolution is a Rest API that returns either the current time
using the "Human Friendly Text" or a time string as a "Human Friendly Text", that is provided by the user.

The folder "scripts" has a text file with scripts that will help in running both of the solutions.
